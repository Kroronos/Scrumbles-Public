The timestamping works like this,

Item.itemTimeLine is a dictionary of timestamps with the following keys:
    AssignedToSprint
    AssignedToUser
    WorkStarted
    Submitted
    Completed

On initialization all values are set to datetime.max()

self.itemTimeLine = {'AssignedToSprint':datetime.max() , 'AssignedToUser':datetime.max(), 'WorkStarted':datetime.max(),'Submitted':datetime.max(),'Completed':datetime.max()}

if Item.itemTimeLine[key] == datetime.max() then the action that relates to that key has not occurred.

When an action that relates to one of the keys occurs, that corresponding value should be updated by DataBlock with datetime.now()

for instance:
def assignItemToUser(item,user):
    # execute code that does the assignment
    # execute code that updates the timestamp


The keys in the dictionary relate to item status, when an item status changes, the appropriate itemTimeLine value should be timestamped by DataBlock


Key                     Status Relation         Status Integer Value
AssignedToSprint        no correspondence               -
AssignedToUser          Assigned                        1
WorkStarted             In Progress                     2
Submitted               Submitted                       3
Completed               Complete                        4



The preceding complexity makes retrieving an items status changes trivial for use in analytics

for instance:
